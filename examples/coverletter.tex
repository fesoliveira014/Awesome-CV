\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a Software Security Analyst working at SIDI, a Samsung research institute in Brazil. I am working in the security analysis of Android and Tizen services and applications on Samsung flagship devices, as well of many of their web applications and services. I have a Bachelor's Degree with Honours in Computer Science from State University of Campinas (Unicamp), in Brazil, and I was a visiting student at University of Toronto for 2 semesters in 2014. I also have development experience from working with a smaller team at my previous position, where I was mostly working in BIOS and bootloaders in security related solutions.

\lettersection{Why ARM?}
ARM has been a paramount of innovation in the computer industry. It was ARM's processors that enabled the existence of most modern handheld and IoT devices, and they continue to bring new and exciting technologies to the market. More recently ARM has been pushing into the desktop and server markets, areas in much need of ARM's vision and insight. I also have great interest in other areas pursued by ARM, such as their mobile GPUs and IoT projects.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
For the past couple years I have worked in both Software Security Engineering and Analysis. Through these I am confident I have acquired many skills that make me an excellent fit for your positions in Low Level Software Engineering. When I commenced these jobs I had never had any experience with security or low level programming, so I had to learn these skills the hard way, which I did with efficiency and efficacy in order to fullfil my tasks. Through these new experiences I became confident in working with mission-critical code and systems. I embrace challenging tasks and I am eager and enthusiastic when working with and learning about new technologies. \\

AMD is a fantastic company and one of the pillars that helped shape the world of technology we live in today. I look forward to the opportunity of working in such a great company and I hope to hear from you soon.
